Thus, your vertebrae become mobile, and the movements in your cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine release all the tension trapped in them.</p>

It has been the marvel of ancient civil engineering technology and science. The bridge was built by many animals crossing the rough and deep sea in between India and Sri Lanka. All those who came to help build the bridge were dedicated and committed to finish the construction. This asana will remind yogis of the goal of yoga: samadhi, total absorption.

Apart from the deformities, you can use this exercise to strengthen your lower body bones, making them more flexible.<br />The same applies for the muscles, the muscles all around the body that would now tangle themselves untying the tension knots that would hold them back from flexibility. This is why the initial stages may come with some muscle pain but with proper practice it would ease. <br />This yoga is mainly known for its proper blood circulation which is done throughout the body as you opt for this yoga. The twists and the stretches are simply a facilitator. <br />If you are suffering from arthritis, this pose will help in educing the stiffness and pain associated with it. <br />It has proven to be helpful in cases of inguinal and femoral hernia.</p>
